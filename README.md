# Intro

Introduced the Make My Folder feature.

# Features

Make My Folder: Prompt the user for a folder name, then create that folder. Within that folder, the extension also creates `Component.tsx`, `Component.test.tsx`, `styles.ts` and `index.ts` files.

The `Component.tsx` file is automatically populated with React component code based on the given folder name.

```bash
  │── Foo
  │   ├── Foo.test.tsx
  │   ├── Foo.tsx
  │   ├── index.ts
  │   └── styles.ts

```
